# Eat-A-Something
A simple web app for you to devour your favorite foods. Add any restaurant food item to your list of available foods to eat, and at the click of a button, devour them. All food items added by the user live in a SQL database and are sorted on the front-end by whether or not theyâ€™ve been devoured yet.

## Functionality
```
WHEN I visit the deployed application
THEN I can view my list of available foods to eat
WHEN I add a new food item
THEN that food item is added to the 'Food to Eat' section
WHEN I click the 'Devour It' button under a food item
THEN that food item is moved to the 'Devoured' section
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN all of my items stay where they are and nothing is impacted
